# HelpJuice Tech Test

A project made for a technical test at Helpjuice

## Proposal for the test: 

Create a page based on Notion where, upon entering the text "/1" in an input field, an `<H1>` tag should be added. If the input is submitted without the prefix "/1", a `<p>` tag should be added.

## Challenges encountered:

- The biggest challenge was that the JavaScript logic, based on dynamic input interaction, was something new to me. Additionally, it was the first time I worked with a deadline in the programming field.

## Technologies used

## Overview of the learning experience!

- The project helped me a lot in practice. I conducted documentation research, participated in forums, inspected the Notion site for ideas on how to proceed, and drew from my experiences with other projects I had completed before this one.
